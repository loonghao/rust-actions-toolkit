# CI CARGO_BUILD_TARGET Environment Variable Fix

## 🐛 Problem Description

The issue occurred when `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` was set globally in the CI environment, causing Cargo to treat even native Linux builds as cross-compilation scenarios. This led to proc-macro compilation errors during the test phase.

### Error Symptoms

```
error: cannot produce proc-macro for `some-crate` as the target `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` does not support these crate types
```

This error appeared even when:
- Running on native x86_64 Linux runners
- Building for the same target (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`)
- Using proc-macro crates like `serde`, `async-trait`, `thiserror`, etc.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The problem was in `action.yml` line 213:

```yaml
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (Fixed in v4.0.0)
if [ "${{ inputs.target }}" != "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" ] && [ "${{ runner.os }}" == "Linux" ]; then
  echo "CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=${{ inputs.target }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV  # ❌ This affects ALL cargo commands
```

### Why This Caused Issues

1. **Global Environment Variable**: `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` was set globally, affecting ALL subsequent Cargo commands
2. **CI Test Phase Impact**: When CI runs `cargo test`, it was affected by this global setting
3. **Proc-macro Confusion**: Cargo treated native builds as cross-compilation due to the global target setting
4. **Test Failures**: Tests failed even on native platforms due to proc-macro compilation issues

## ✅ Solution Implemented in v4.0.0

### Fixed Code

```yaml
# FIXED CODE (v4.0.0+)
# DO NOT set CARGO_BUILD_TARGET globally as it affects CI tests
# Instead, let taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action handle target-specific builds
if [ "${{ inputs.target }}" != "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" ] && [ "${{ runner.os }}" == "Linux" ]; then
  echo "📦 Cross-compilation will be handled by upload-rust-binary-action for target (${{ inputs.target }})"
  echo "🧪 CI tests will run on host platform (x86_64-linux) to avoid proc-macro issues"
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Global CARGO_BUILD_TARGET**: No longer set globally in the environment
2. **Delegated to Build Tool**: Let `taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action` handle target-specific compilation
3. **Preserved CI Testing**: CI tests now run on the native platform without interference
4. **Maintained Cross-compilation**: Release builds still work correctly for all targets

## 🎯 Benefits of the Fix

### For CI (Testing)
- ✅ **Native Testing**: Tests run on native platform without cross-compilation complexity
- ✅ **Proc-macro Compatibility**: All proc-macro crates work correctly during testing
- ✅ **Faster CI**: No cross-compilation overhead during CI phase
- ✅ **Reliable Results**: Consistent test results across all projects

### For Release (Building)
- ✅ **Cross-compilation Still Works**: `taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action` handles target-specific builds
- ✅ **Proc-macro Protection**: Build tool manages proc-macro compilation correctly
- ✅ **All Targets Supported**: Windows, macOS, Linux (musl/gnu) all work
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: No manual workarounds needed

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### If You're Using v3.x and Experiencing This Issue

**Update to v4.0.0+**:
```yaml
# From
- uses: loonghao/rust-actions-toolkit@v3
# To  
- uses: loonghao/rust-actions-toolkit@v4
```

### If You Have Manual Workarounds

**Remove these workarounds** (no longer needed in v4.0.0+):
```yaml
# Remove these if you added them as workarounds
env:
  CARGO_BUILD_TARGET: ""  # ❌ Remove this
  
# Remove manual unset commands
- run: unset CARGO_BUILD_TARGET  # ❌ Remove this
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

After updating to v4.0.0+, you should see:

### Successful CI Logs
```
🧪 CI tests will run on host platform (x86_64-linux) to avoid proc-macro issues
📦 Cross-compilation will be handled by upload-rust-binary-action for target (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)
```

### No More Proc-macro Errors
```
✅ cargo test --all-features  # Should pass without proc-macro errors
✅ cargo build --release      # Should work for all targets
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### Environment Variable Scope

| Phase | CARGO_BUILD_TARGET | Behavior |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **CI Testing** | Not set | Native compilation, proc-macros work |
| **Release Building** | Handled by build tool | Cross-compilation when needed |

### Affected Crates (Now Fixed)

All proc-macro crates now work correctly in CI:
- ✅ **serde** (derive macros)
- ✅ **async-trait** 
- ✅ **thiserror**
- ✅ **clap** (derive macros)
- ✅ **tokio** (macros)
- ✅ **syn** & **quote**

## 📝 Summary

The v4.0.0 fix ensures that:
1. **CI tests run natively** without cross-compilation interference
2. **Release builds handle cross-compilation** correctly when needed  
3. **Proc-macro crates work** in both CI and release phases
4. **Zero configuration** required from users

This fix eliminates a major source of CI failures while maintaining full cross-compilation capabilities for releases.
