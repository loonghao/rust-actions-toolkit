# 🐳 Docker Images Status

## Current Status: 🚧 Building (All Issues Fixed)

The Docker images for rust-actions-toolkit are currently being built. All major blocking issues have been resolved.

### ✅ Issues Resolved

1. **Branch Configuration** - Updated Docker workflow to use `master` branch
2. **Tool Installation** - Simplified base image to avoid cargo tool conflicts
3. **User Creation** - Fixed UID/GID conflicts in Ubuntu 24.04
4. **GHCR Permissions** - Added `packages: write` permission for publishing
5. **Build Reliability** - Improved error handling throughout
6. **Cargo Permissions** - Fixed cargo directory ownership for rust user in all images

### 🕐 Expected Timeline

- **Base image**: ~30-45 minutes (after all fixes)
- **Specialized images**: ~60-90 minutes total
- **Full availability**: Within 2 hours

### 🚀 Use Without Docker (Recommended)

```yaml
# This works immediately - no Docker required
- uses: loonghao/rust-actions-toolkit@v2.0.2
  with:
    command: ci
```
